Your Identity

The first thing you should do when you install Git is to set your user name and email address. This is important because every Git commit uses this information, and itâ€™s immutably baked into the commits you start creating:

$ git config --global user.name "Antonio Italiano"
$ git config --global user.email satskiy.a@gmail.com
